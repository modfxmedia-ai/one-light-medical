/**
 * The deck flips as the section is scrolled through, held in place while it does.
 *
 * A tall outer track supplies the scroll distance and a sticky inner panel pins
 * the card deck to the viewport, so the reviews turn over in place before the
 * page moves on. The section heading stays in normal flow above the track so it
 * is never pulled into the pin and clipped on shorter screens. Which review is showing comes from how far through
 * the track the viewport has travelled.
 *
 * The index is stepped rather than tied continuously to scroll position: CSS
 * handles each turn, so stopping mid-scroll leaves a settled card rather than one
 * frozen half-rotated.
 *
 * Pinning is applied only after mount, and never for a reader who has asked to
 * reduce motion. Without it the track keeps its natural height and the first
 * review is simply on the page, which is also what the server sends -- so no
 * script means no vast empty scroll region, just a static card. Every review is
 * in the markup either way, so all of them are crawlable.
